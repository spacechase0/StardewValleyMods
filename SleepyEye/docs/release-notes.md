# Release notes
## 1.1.1
Released 17 July 2021. Updated by Pathoschild.

* Migrated from PyTK to SpaceCore.
* Fixed error when opening some shops.

**Update note:**  
You no longer need PyTK to use Sleepy Eye. Existing tent items in your save should be migrated
automatically. If you find a broken item named `PyTK|Item|SleepyEye.TentTool,  SleepyEye|`, you can
fix it by moving it into your inventory, then saving and reloading the save to migrate it.
