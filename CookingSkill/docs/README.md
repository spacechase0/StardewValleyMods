# Cooking Skill
This is the source code. Releases can be found at:
* [My site](http://spacechase0.com/mods/stardew-valley/cooking-skill/)

This adds in a new cooking skill. Food cooked in the kitchen recovers more energy/health the higher
level you are.

The mod also adds a chance of silver and gold food (which increases as you level).

* Level 5: Gourmet - +20% sell price
* Level 10: Efficient - 15% chance to not consume ingredients
* Level 10: Professional Chef - Home-cooked meals are always at least silver
* Level 5: Satisfying - +25% buff duration once eaten
* Level 10: Intense Flavors - Food buffs are one level stronger once eaten
* Level 10: Secret Spices - Provides a few random buffs when eating unbuffed food

Experience is gained by cooking. Generally speaking, better food gives more experience.

Note: This fixes food buff duration becoming less as the day goes in. (This doesn't matter for
vanilla play, but can become noticeable if playing with something like TimeSpeed.)

Supports Experience Bars and All Professions.
