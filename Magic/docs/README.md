the game.

## Install

   * [Mana Bar](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7831);

## Use
This is an early release. It may be unbalanced and/or buggy.

### Unlock magic
To unlock magic, visit the wizard with three hearts or more. The magic UI should appear in the
bottom-left corner right after the event. Then visit the [altar](screenshot-altar.png) in Pierre's
shop and equip some spells by dragging a spell onto the hotbar along the right side of the menu.

To get the mana potion recipe, visit the adventurer's guild.

If you have PyTK installed, a new TV channel will give a random hint each day about where you can
use the Analyze spell to learn new spells.

### Use magic
To cast a spell, hold `Q` and press a number key (`1` through `4`) corresponding to the spell's
position in the hotbar. Press `Q` + `Tab` to swap between spell sets.

### Professions
You gain magic XP by casting spells. Leveling up increases your mana regen rate, and unlocks some
professions:

* Level 5: Potential (+2 spell upgrade points).
  * Level 10: Prodigy (+2 spell upgrade points).
  * Level 10: Memory (adds a fifth spell per spell set).
* Level 5: Mana Regen I (doubles mana regen speed).
  * Level 10: Mana Regen II (triples base mana regen speed).
  * Level 10: Mana Reserve (+500 max mana).

### Spell list
**This section contains spoilers!** The spells are meant to be discovered in-game.
