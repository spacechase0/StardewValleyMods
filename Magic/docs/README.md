## Use
This is an early release. It may be unbalanced and/or buggy.

To unlock magic, visit the wizard with three hearts or more. Then visit the
[altar](screenshot-altar.png) in Pierre's shop and equip some spells by dragging a spell onto the
hotbar along the right side of the menu. After you sleep overnight, the magic UI will appear in the
bottom-left corner.

To cast a spell, hold `Q` and press a number key (`1` through `4`) corresponding to the spell's
position in the hotbar. Press `Tab` to swap between spell sets.

To get the mana potion recipe, visit the adventurer's guild.

Hints on using the Analyze spell to unlock more spells appear on the TV.
