Come to a new festival on Summer 5 at the Beach, where you can race some of your friends in the
town!

Don't put anything weird in the bonfire.

## Things to note
* Made for the SDV Discord Server 2020 Summer Event, theme: wavy
* Before the race the text explaining the powerups extends past the textbox. It still functions as
  intended just a bit harder to read the bottom word.
* When using the Stardrop powerup your character may jump forward and backwards, this is because of
  how fast you're going.
