    "Haley_spouse": "I'm happy to stay on land and watch everyone surf. Emily thinks it would be good for me to try exciting things but this is a bit much for me.",
    "Sebastian_spouse": "What all do you think is under the water? Abigail sent me a post about a sea creature living underneath. Do you think that's true?",
    "Sam_spouse": "I wanted to participate but my mom thinks it's best to not because of Vincent. She doesn't want him getting any ideas and I can't blame her. He's a wild little bother.",
    "Alex_spouse": "You don't have to worry about me. I withdrew my entry since Sam couldn't join in. We were gonna see who was the fastest: me or the skateboarder.",
    "Harvey_spouse": "Please don't get hurt @. I don't want you colliding into a rock and hitting your head.",
    "Elliott_spouse": "Sometimes I miss that old, drafty cabin. Our home is much nicer.",
    "Emily_spouse": "I still try to push Haley to try new things. She always talked about getting out of Pelican Town but where in the city can she ride some waves?",
    "Abigail": "Do you plan on participating in the race @?#$b#I wanted to but I'm a little afraid of what might be in the water....$3",
    "Emily": "Haley always wants to try exciting things but she didn't want to participate in the race.#$b#So I took her place! Best of luck to you @!$h",
    "Robin": "Lewis asked me to make some surfboards since they were too expensive to import.",

    "Maru": "Mmm, I'm a little nervous about the surfing competition but Harvey said he'd participate with me.",
    "Sebastian": "I could use some adrenaline but I'll stick to my bike.",
    "Linus": "I would much rather be swimming in the water than on top of it.",
    "Pierre": "Take a look at all the surfboards Robin made. I'm honored to be able to sell such fine craftsmanship.",

    "Alex": "I was going to show off these muscles and race Sam but he backed out last minute.",
    "George": "I used to surf back in my youth. Went to Oahu, and Tavarua if you can believe this old man.",

    "Penny": "I'm looking forward to the surfing competition later! Do you think I should start preparing for next year @?",
    "Pam": "We've never had a festival like this in the valley before you got here @. No way Lewis thought up this on his own.",
    "Haley": "Emily kept saying how I should try out surfing but I don't want my hair getting ruined.#$b#A swim cap? No! That would look horrible.$a",
    "Jodi": "I managed to talk the boys out of surfing this year.#$b#Sam's a natural because of his skateboarding but I don't want him hurting himself on a rock or getting caught up in a net.#$b#Vincent? He's too young but maybe when he's older.",
    "Kent": "Jodi should have let the kids participate this year. They're young. They need to experience more positive things in their lives.",
    "Marlon": "There isn't a sword or bow on this planet that can damage the waves. Best of luck to you @.",
    "Sam": "Alex wanted to race but I just want to relax. I had the perfect excuse too.",
    "Leah": "I'm staying on land to get inspiration for my next art piece. Maybe I'll call it Valley Waves.",
    "Shane": "I'm looking forward to the race later! We have an extra board if you want to participate @.",
    "Marnie": "Lewis told me that Shane signed up for the race. It was startling at first but I know he can win.",

    "Gus": "I always love getting to spend a day out of the saloon. This festival is going to be great.$h",
    "Dwarf": "On the surface people aren't afraid of water. They ride it. But down here? The water rushes in through the cracks.",
