**Customize Exterior** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you
customize the exterior of your buildings individually. This lets you have a different texture for
each instance of a building ([see example](screenshot-buildings.png)).

## Use
### Adding textures
This mod has no built-in custom textures; you need to download the textures you want to use.

Customize Exterior will create a `Buildings` subfolder the first time you run it. You can install
any number of texture sets by putting each one in its own subfolder of `Buildings`. The name of
each file should match the building in your game's `Content/Buildings` folder. Each texture can be
a `.png` or `.xnb` file.

For example:

```
📁 Mods/
   📁 CustomizeExterior/
      📁 Buildings/
         📁 TextureSetA
            🗎 Shed.xnb
            🗎 houses.xnb
              ...
         📁 TextureSetB
            🗎 Shed.png
            🗎 houses.png
              ...
```

You can make textures seasonal by adding season folders within the texture set:

```
📁 Mods/
   📁 CustomizeExterior/
      📁 Buildings/
         📁 TextureSetA
            📁 spring/
               🗎 Shed.xnb
               🗎 houses.xnb
                 ...
            📁 summer/
               🗎 Shed.xnb
               🗎 houses.xnb
                 ...
            📁 fall/
               🗎 Shed.xnb
               🗎 houses.xnb
                 ...
            📁 winter/
               🗎 Shed.xnb
               🗎 houses.xnb
                 ...
```
