## Install
This mod isn't released yet.

1. ~~Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).~~
2. ~~Install this mod from Nexus Mods.~~

## Use
Load your save, go to the area you want to terraform, and run the `terraform` command in the SMAPI
console to show the edit UI. Click the boxes on the sidebar to choose the tile type, then click on
the map tiles you want to replace. You can currently place two types of dirt, three types of grass,
and two types of water.
