## 1.9.0
Released 04 September 2021 for SMAPI 3.12.6 or later. Updated by Pathoschild.

* Expanded Preconditions Utility (EPU) is now optional.  
  _Json Assets now handles vanilla conditions itself. If a content pack uses EPU-specific conditions
  and you don't have it installed, Json Assets will log an error and treat those conditions as
  always failed._
* Fixed resource clumps outside the farm not ID-fixed.
* Fixed error when ID-fixing bundles with invalid item IDs.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
If your content pack uses EPU-specific conditions in a `PurchaseRequirements` field, adding it as a
[manifest dependency](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest#Dependencies)
and to your mod description is recommended to avoid confusion.

These conditions are EPU-specific: `!` (to reverse a condition), `CommunityCenterComplete`,
`FarmHouseUpgradeLevel`, `HasCookingRecipe`, `HasCraftingRecipe`, `HasItem`, `HasMod`,
`JojaMartComplete`, `NPCAt`, `SeededRandom`, and `SkillLevel`.
