## Introduction
### What is Json Assets?
Json Assets allows you to add custom objects to the game without having to create a SMAPI mod or altering vanilla files. Currently, Json Assets supports the following types of items:
* Crops
* Fruit Trees
* Recipes
* Craftables (16x16)
* Big-Craftables (16x32)
* Hats (20x80)
* Weapons (16x16)
* Shirts & Pants
* Boots (16x16)
* Tailoring Recipes
* Fences

Examples of how to set up all types of objects can be found in the [PPJA Resource Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4590). I also highly recommend looking up preexisting content packs for further examples:

* [Farmer to Florist](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2075) contains examples of big craftables.
* [Starbrew Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1764) contains examples using all valid EdibleBuff fields.
* [Fantasy Crops](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1610) contains examples of crops producing vanilla items.
* [PPJA Home of Abandoned Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3374) contains examples of hats, weapons, and clothing.
* [Artisan Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1926) contains examples of a bit of everything including animations.
* [Dinosaur Shirts and Boots](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4996) contains examples of boots.
* [Korea Blossom](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6064) contains examples of custom giant crops added via JA.
* [More Fences](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/index.php?threads/more-fences.2105/) contains examples of fences.

### Things to note before you start
* `SkillUnlockName` & `SkillUnlockLevel` are valid but it is not recommended to use them. This adds the recipe to the level up menu, which only can handle a very small number of new recipes before the player cannot click to the next day screen. SDV 1.5 should have somewhat resolved this issue. Use and test at your own risk. If you want your recipe to unlock via a skill/level up it is recommended to send the recipe via mail using [Mail Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536) instead.
* Example packs are listed above and should be used as a reference. If you're unsure of how something works it is recommended that you check out a preexisting pack. Every feature for JA more or less has an example floating around somewhere.

### Companion mods
Json Assets is a great tool if you want to add one of the above objects, but there are other frameworks out there that pair well with Json Assets:

 * [Producer Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4970) to add machines.
 * [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
 * [Better Artisan Good Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2080) to customize the appearance of artisan products. \*Note: Does not currently support objects added by JA but good for keeping a similar aesthetic.
 * [Mail Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536) to send objects & cooking/crafting recipes.
 * [Shop Tile Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005) to add shops easier with full JA pack support.
 * [Farm Type Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3231) useful for adding custom foraging objects.
 * [Hybrid Crop Engine](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6577) allows you to crossbreed crops together.
 * [Custom Furniture](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1254) JA does not support furniture. You still have to use Custom Furniture for that.
 * [Bigger Craftables](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7530) allows you to make craftables larger than 16x32.

 This list is not meant to be comprehensive as many mods support JA objects. If you're unsure if a mod supports JA objects it's recommended to read the mod description, release notes, or ask the creator.

## Supported content
### Overview
There are nine main folders you are likely to see when downloading Json Asset content packs:

* BigCraftables
* Crops
* FruitTrees
* Objects
* Hats
* Weapons
* Shirts
* Pants
* Boots
* Tailoring
* Fences

You will also see a `manifest.json` for SMAPI to read (see [content packs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:SMAPI_APIs#Manifest) on the wiki).
Each of these folders contains subfolders that at minimum contains a `json` and a `png`.

### Big craftables
Big craftables are objects like scarecrows that are 16x32.

A big craftable subfolder is a folder with these files:
* a `big-craftable.json`;
* a `big-craftable.png`; Size: 16x32

The `big-craftable.json` contains these fields:

field                    | purpose
-------------------------| -------
`Name`                   | The name you would like your object to have. This does not need to be identical to the folder but it is recommend to keep names consistant. If you add `arecrow` to the name the item will function as a scarecrow.
`Price`                  | How much your item sells for.
`CanSell`                | If you can sell the BigCraftble or not. Set to `true` or `false`. Default is `true`.
`Description`            | Description for what this does. Note if it does anything special like provide light.
`ProvidesLight`          | On/Off switch for if it provides light or not. Set to `true` or `false`.
`Recipe`                 | Begins the recipe block. All of the following fields must go inside the recipe block:
`ResultCount`            | How many of the product does the recipe produce. The game does not handle this correctly for BigCraftables, so it should generally be limited to `1`.
`Ingredients`            |  Begins defining the ingredients required to craft the object.
`Object` & `Count`       | Fields that are part of `Ingredients`. You can add up to five different ingredients to a recipe. You can use either the item ID or the name of the object. `Object` fields that contain a negative value are the generic ID. Example: Rather than using a specific milk, -6 allows for any milk to be used. You cannot use context tags for this field.
`IsDefault`              | _(optional)_ Setting this to `true` will have the recipe already unlocked. Setting this to `false` (or excluding this field) will require additional fields specifiying how to obtain the recipe.
`CanPurchase`            | Set this to `true` if `IsDefault` is set to `false` or excluded from the `json`.
`PurchaseFrom`           | Who you can purchase the recipe from. See [a list of valid shop IDs](#shops). `Pierre` is the default vendor.
`PurchasePrice`          | How much you can purchase the recipe for.
`PurchaseRequirements`   | See [Event Preconditions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data#Event_preconditions). If you do not want to have any `PurchaseRequirements` set this to `null`.
`AdditionalPurchaseData` | Extra shops where the item can be purchased from. This is a list of entries with `PurchasePrice`, `PurchaseFrom`, and `PurchaseRequirements` equivalent to the above fields.
`SkillUnlockName`        | _(optional)_ The name of the [skill](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skills) required for unlock.
`SkillUnlockLevel`       | _(optional)_ The level, 1 - 9, required to unlock. Level 10 does not currently work for BigCraftables.
`ReserveNextIndex`       | _(optional)_ Used for animations with PFM. Set to `true` or `false`. Reserves 1 index. Useful for machines that work like the Charcoal Kiln. Cannot be used with `ReserveExtraIndexCount`.
`ReserveExtraIndexCount` | _(optional)_ Used for animations with PFM. Set to the number of additional frames needed. See [Machine Animations](#machine-animations) for more information. Cannot be used with `ReserveNextIndex`.
`EnableWithMod`          | _(optional)_ Enables the craftable when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"EnableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.
`DisableWithMod`         | _(optional)_ Disables the craftable when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"DisableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.

Big Craftables do not support gift tastes.

#### Machine animations
`ReserveExtraIndexCount` is used primarily for big-craftable machines. It may also be useful for a SMPAI mod that utilizes chest animation. Unlike CFR, each frame of the machine will need to be it's own image. Starting with `big-craftble`, `big-craftable-2` `big-craftable-3` and so on. `big-craftable` (no numbers) is considered to be 0 in the index. So for our example of the Alembic, there is the starting frame and then 7 additional frames afterwards for the animation.

Here is a preview of the folder contents
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Du4WNM5.png)

Example:
```
{
    "Name": "Alembic",
    "Description": "Distills flowers, fruits, herbs, and vegetables into essential oils.",
    "Price": 1,
    "ProvidesLight": false,
    "ReserveExtraIndexCount": 7,
    "Recipe":
    {
        "ResultCount": 1,
        "Ingredients": [
        {
            "Object": 334,
            "Count": 5,
        },
        {
            "Object": 766,
            "Count": 50,
        },
        {
            "Object": 709,
            "Count": 10,
        }, ],
        "CanPurchase": false,
    },
}
```

If you want an image to constantly animate you will need to use the [Content Patcher API](#content-patcher-api).

<details>
  <summary> <b>Expand for more information on PFM usage </b> </summary>

When using with PFM in the `ProducersConfig.json` this information would translate to:

```
{
    "ProducerName": "Alembic",
    "AlternateFrameProducing": false,
    "AlternateFrameWhenReady": false,
    "DisableBouncingAnimationWhileWorking": true, // Disables defualt bouncing animation
    "ProducingAnimation": {
            "RelativeFrameIndex": [1,2,3,4,5,6], //big-craftable-2 through big-craftable-7
            "FrameInterval": 10
        },
        "ReadyAnimation":
        {
          "RelativeFrameIndex": [7], // big-craftable-8
      },
  },
```

This is mentioned because JA & PFM indexs are one off of each other. `big-craftable` is your idle animation. `big-craftable-2` through `big-craftable-7` are your `ProducingAnimation` `RelativeFrameIndex`. Finally `big-craftable-8` is your `ReadyAnimation` `RelativeFrameIndex`. You can have less or more than 8 `big-craftable` just keep in mind to bump each number down one.

</details>

### Crops
A crop subfolder is a folder with these files:

* a `crop.json`;
* a `crop.png`; Size: 128x32
* a `seeds.png`; Size: 16x16
* _(optional)_ a `giant.png`; Size: 48x63 See [Giant Crops](#giant-crops) for more information.

field                      | purpose
-------------------------- | -------
`Name`                     | The name you would like your object to have. This does not need to be identical to the folder but it is recommend to keep names consistant.
`Price`                    | How much your item sells for.
`Product`                  | Determines what the crop produces. This will correspond to a folder with the same name in `Objects` (ex. Both folders will be named "Honeysuckle"). _(optional)_ You can produce vanilla items. Instead of a named object you will use the objects ID number and not include a corresponding `Objects` folder.
`SeedName`                 | The seed name of the crop. Typically crop name + seeds or starter. Do not put `Sapling` at the end of the seed name or it will not function properly. If you're trying to make a fruit tree, see [fruit trees](#fruit-trees).
`SeedDescription`          | Describe what season you plant these in. Also note if it continues to grow after first harvest and how many days it takes to regrow.
`Type`                     | Vanilla types are `Flower`, `Fruit`, `Vegetable`, `Gem`, `Fish`, `Egg`, `Milk`, `Cooking`, `Crafting`, `Mineral`, `Meat`, `Metal`, `Junk`, `Syrup`, `MonsterLoot`, `ArtisanGoods`, `AnimalGoods`, `Greens`, and `Seeds`.
`SeedSellPrice`            | How much the seeds sell for. *Not to be confused with `SeedPurchasePrice`.*
`CropType`                 | Available types are `Normal`, `IndoorsOnly`, and `Paddy`. If no `CropType` is specified (largely affecting pre-SDV1.4 crops) `Normal` is the default. `IndoorsOnly` means it can only grow when inside (greenhouse or garden pot). `Paddy` means it follows the same rules as rice (SDV1.4) and does not need watered if planted around a water source.
`Seasons`                  | Seasons must be in lowercase and in quotation marks, so if you want to make your crop last all year, you'd put in "spring", "summer", "fall", "winter".
`Phases`                   | Determines how many days it takes to reach each corresponding growth sprite on the crop.png. Crops must have 5 phases if it regrows, but can have 2-6 if it is a one-time harvest. The numbers in phases refer to how many days it takes for the plant to reach that phase. Seeds do not have a phase. For example, a crop with `[3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` will take 3 days to reach the first growth sprite, 13 days to reach maturity, and does not regrow.
`RegrowthPhase`            | If your plant is a one time harvest set this to `-1`. If it does, this determines which sprite the regrowth starts at. I typically recommend the sprite right before the harvest. *Requires additional sprite at the end of the crop.png*
`HarvestWithScythe`        | Set to `true` or `false`.
`TrellisCrop`              | Set to `true` or `false`. Determines if you can pass through a crop or not.
`Colors`                   | Colors use RGBA for color picking, set to `null` if your plant does not have colors. Ex. ["227, 109, 103, 255", "227, 137, 86, 255"] This crop has two different colors.
`Bonus`                    | This block determines the chance to get multiple crops.
`MinimumPerHarvest`        | Minimum number of crops you will get per harvest. Must be one or greater.
`MaximumPerHarvest`        | Maximum number of crops you will get per harvest. Must be one or greater. *Recommended not to exceed 10*.
`MaxIncreasePerFarmLevel`  | How many farming skill experience points you get from harvesting.
`ExtraChance`              | Value between 0 and 1.
`SeedPurchasePrice`        | How much you can purchase seeds for.
`SeedPurchaseFrom`         | Who you can purchase seeds from. See [a list of valid shop IDs](#shops). `Pierre` is the default vendor.
`SeedPurchaseRequirements` | See [Event Preconditions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data#Event_preconditions). If you do not want to have any `SeedPurchaseRequirements` set this to `null`.
`SeedAdditionalPurchaseData` | Extra shops where the seed can be purchased from. This is a list of entries with `PurchasePrice`, `PurchaseFrom`, and `PurchaseRequirements` equivalent to the above fields.
`EnableWithMod`            | _(optional)_ Enables the crop when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"EnableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.
`DisableWithMod`           | _(optional)_ Disables the crop when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"DisableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.

**Facts about custom crops:**
* Sprites are 32px tall and there are 2 per row. Vanilla `Tilesheets\crops` is 256 x 672 px.
* The first two frames on each `crop.png` are reserved for seed sprites.
* JA starts numbering crops at ID 100, and the first sprites are placed at 0,1600.

#### Giant crops
Giant crops work the same way as vanilla giant crops. It is not recommended to make regrowable crops have a giant variant as once they become giant and are harvested they will not replant themselves. This is not a bug and is intended behavior. Mods that include giant regrowable crops should include a disclaimer so users are aware that they may lose their regrowing crops. Below is a sample disclaimer created by SpringsSong:

"Giant Crops were never meant to be regrown, they were meant to be a one-off of the crop when the proper conditions were met. If you use the regrowing crops variant of these giant crops, you will lose your crops when you harvest them. This is intentional, not a bug, and will not be fixed."

Giant crops are 48x64. Custom giant crops need to be placed inside the corresponding `Crops` folder and named `giant.png`.

If you're looking to expand the vanilla giant crop offering you'll need to use [More Giant Crops](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5263).

### Fruit trees
A fruit trees subfolder is a folder with these files:

* a `tree.json`;
* a `tree.png`; Size: 432x80
* a `sapling.png`; Size: 16x16

field                         | purpose
----------------------------- | -------
`Name`                        | The name you would like your object to have. This does not need to be identical to the folder but it is recommend to keep names consistant.
`Price`                       | How much your item sells for.
`Product`                     | Determines what the fruit tree produces. This will correspond to a folder with the same name in `Objects` (ex. Both folders will be named "Honeysuckle"). _(optional)_ You can produce vanilla items. Instead of a named object you will use the objects ID number and not include a corresponding `Objects` folder.
`SaplingName`                 | The name of the sapling, typically product + sapling.
`SaplingDescription`          | The description of the sapling, often sticks to vanilla format: Takes 28 days to produce a mature `product` tree. Bears `type` in the summer. Only grows if the 8 surrounding \"tiles\" are empty.
`Season`                      | Season must be in lowercase and in quotation marks. Fruit trees can support only one season.
`SaplingPurchasePrice`        | Determines how much the sapling can be purchased for.
`SaplingPurchaseFrom`         | Who you can purchase saplings from. See [a list of valid shop IDs](#shops). `Pierre` is the default vendor.
`SaplingPurchaseRequirements` | See [Event Preconditions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data#Event_preconditions). If you do not want to have any `SaplingPurchaseRequirements` set this to `null`.
`SaplingAdditionalPurchaseData` | Extra shops where the sapling can be purchased from. This is a list of entries with `PurchasePrice`, `PurchaseFrom`, and `PurchaseRequirements` equivalent to the above fields.
`EnableWithMod`               | _(optional)_ Enables the fruit tree when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"EnableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.
`DisableWithMod`              | _(optional)_ Disables the fruit tree when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"DisableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.

**Facts about custom trees:**
* Sprites are 80px tall and there is only 1 tree per row. Vanilla `Tilesheets\fruitTrees` has partial sprites for a 7th tree and is 432 x 560 px.
* JA starts numbering its trees at ID 10, and the first sprites are placed at 0,800.

### Objects
Objects (16x16) can be added via Json Assets through the `Objects` folder. Unless your crop or fruit tree is producing a vanilla item, it will need to have a corresponding folder in `Objects`

An object subfolder for a recipe is a folder that contains these files:

* an `object.json`;
* an `object.png`;
* _(optional)_ a `color.png`; Size: 16x16, this will be a grayscale version of the part you want colored. *[See Mizu's Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2028) for an example*.

field                  | purpose
---------------------- | -------
`Name`                 | The name you would like your object to have. This does not need to be identical to the folder but it is recommend to keep names consistant.
`Price`                | How much your item sells for.
`CanSell`              | If you can sell the object or not. Set to `true` or `false`. Default is `true`.
`Description`          | Description of the product.
`Category`             | Use one of the following categories: `Flower`, `Fruit`, `Vegetable`, `Gem`, `Fish`, `Egg`, `Milk`, `Cooking`, `Crafting`, `Mineral`, `Meat`, `Metal`, `Junk`, `Syrup`, `MonsterLoot`, `ArtisanGoods`, `Greens`, `AnimalGoods` and `Seeds`. Alternatively you can set the category to either `Crafting` or `Cooking` depending on the menu you want it to appear in if you want the object to be craftable.
`CategoryTextOverride` | _(optional_) Visually allows you to alter what category the item appears as. Examples include: `herb`, `spice`, `hybrid`.
`CategoryColorOverride`| _(optional)_ Works the same as `Colors` field using RGBA, but only allows one input. Alters the text color of the category.
`Edibility`            | Edibility is for health, energy is calculated by the game. For inedibile items, set to -300.
`EdibleIsDrink`        | Set to `true` or `false`.
`EdibleBuffs`          | Either set to `null` or include **all** required valid fields. It will not work if you only use the needed fields. Set unused fields to 0. Supports negative values. Required valid fields: `Farming`, `Fishing`, `Mining`, `Luck`, `Duration`. Optional valid fields: `Foraging`, `MaxStamina`, `MagnetRadius`, `Speed`, `Defense`, `Attack`.
`IsColored`            |  _(optional)_ Set this value to `true` if your product is colored. If not, set to `false`. Any object that comes from a colored crop must also be colored. Any object with `IsColored` set to `true` must also have a `color.png` (see above) included in the object subfolder.
`Recipe`               | Begins the recipe block. If you do not want to have a recipe for this object set to `null`. If you do want to have a recipe, all of the following fields must go inside the recipe block:
`ResultCount`          | How many of the product does the recipe produce.
`Ingredients`          | Begins defining the ingredients required to craft the object.
`Object` & `Count`     | Fields that are part of `Ingredients`. You can add up to five different ingredients to a recipe. You can use either the item ID or the name of the object. `Object` fields that contain a negative value are the generic ID. Example: Rather than using a specific milk, -6 allows for any milk to be used. You cannot use context tags for this field.
`IsDefault`            | _(optional)_ Setting this to `true` will have the recipe already unlocked. Setting this to `false` (or excluding this field) will require additional fields specifiying how to obtain the recipe.
`CanPurchase`          | Set this to `true` if `IsDefault` is set to `false` or excluded from the `json`.
`PurchaseFrom`         | Who you can purchase the recipe from. See [a list of valid shop IDs](#shops). `Pierre` is the default vendor.
`PurchasePrice`        | How much you can purchase the recipe for.
`PurchaseRequirements` | See [Event Preconditions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data#Event_preconditions). If you do not want to have any `PurchaseRequirements` set this to `null`.
`AdditionalPurchaseData` | Extra shops where the item can be purchased from. This is a list of entries with `PurchasePrice`, `PurchaseFrom`, and `PurchaseRequirements` equivalent to the above fields.
`SkillUnlockName`      | _(optional)_ The name of the [skill](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skills) required for unlock.
`SkillUnlockLevel`     | _(optional)_ The level, 1 - 10, required to unlock.
`EnableWithMod`        | _(optional)_ Enables the recipe when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"EnableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.
`DisableWithMod`       | _(optional)_ Disables the recipe when a specific mod is installed. Example: `"DisableWithMod": "ppja.moretrees"`. Does not support multiple uniqueIDs.

### Hats
Hats are 20x80 and can be added through a `Hats` folder. All hats are purchaseable through [hat mouse](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Abandoned_House). There is a limit of 87 custom hats.

A hats subfolder for a hat is a folder that contains these files:

* a `hat.json`;
* a `hat.png`;

field                  | purpose
---------------------- | -------
`Name`                 | The name you would like your object to have. This does not need to be identical to the folder but it is recommend to keep names consistant.
`Description`          | Description of the product.
`PurchasePrice`        | How much you can purchase the hat for.
`ShowHair`             | Set this to `true` or `false` depending on if you want the players' hair to be visible or not. Setting this to `false` is a good idea for masks.

Tailoring does not support localization.
Below is a bit more about item tag names from Mr. Podunkian.

"It's `item_itemname` where `itemname` is the item's name in all lowercase, with spaces replaced with \_'s and ' (apostrophe) removed. So mermaid's pendant would be `item_mermaids_pendant`. They have an alternative id, which is `id_(o for normal objects)_(id number)`. Typing in `debug listtags` into SMAPI [will] print out all of the context tags for that item. You need to use the alt ID for any items that might have name collisions."

### Fences
Fences are 48x352 and can be added via Json Assets through the `Fences` folder.

A fences subfolder is a folder that contains these files;

* a `fence.json`;
* a `fence.png`;
* an `object.png`;

The `fence.png` is setup the same way as the vanilla fences. The `object.png` is used to show how it will appear in the crafting menu, hotbar, and the player holding the fence.

field                  | purpose
---------------------- | -------
`Name`                 | The name you would like your fence to have. This does not need to be identical to the folder but it is recommend to keep names consistant.

`MaxHealth`            | Maximum number of hit points the fence has before it breaks.
`RepairMaterial`       | The material used to repair the fence. If using a vanilla object, you will have to use the objects ID number. If using a custom object added by Json Assets, you will have to use the name. Ex. "Honeysuckle".
`BreakTool`            | The tool type used to break the fence.
`PlacementSound`       | The Sound Bank ID (Name) that is heard when the fence is placed. You can find a list of known Sound Bank ID [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpDrw23peQiq-C7F2FjYOMePaYe0Rc9BwQsj3h6sjyo/edit#gid=239695361). You may have to change the tab to Sound Bank IDs at the bottom.
`RepairSound`          | Same as `PlacementSound` except the sound that is heard when the fence is repaied. Can be a different Sound Bank ID (Name).
`Recipe`               | Begins the recipe block. All of the following fields must go inside the recipe block:
`ResultCount`          | How many of the product does the recipe produce.
`Ingredients`          | If using a vanilla object, you will have to use the objects ID number. You can use either the item ID or the name of the object. If using a custom object added by Json Assets, you will have to use the name. Ex. "Honeysuckle".
`Object` & `Count`     | Fields that are part of `Ingredients`. You can add up to five different ingredients to a recipe. `Object` fields that contain a negative value are the generic ID. Example: Rather than using a specific milk, -6 allows for any milk to be used.
`IsDefault`            | _(optional)_ Setting this to `true` will have the recipe already unlocked. Setting this to `false` (or excluding this field) will require additional fields specifiying how to obtain the recipe:
`CanPurchase`          | Set this to `true` if `IsDefault` is set to `false` or excluded from the `json`.
`PurchaseFrom`         | Who you can purchase the recipe from. See [a list of valid shop IDs](#shops). `Pierre` is the default vendor.
`PurchasePrice`        | How much you can purchase the recipe for.
`PurchaseRequirements` | See [Event Preconditions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data#Event_preconditions). If you do not want to have any `PurchaseRequirements` set this to `null`.
`AdditionalPurchaseData` | Extra shops where the item can be purchased from. This is a list of entries with `PurchasePrice`, `PurchaseFrom`, and `PurchaseRequirements` equivalent to the above fields.
`SkillUnlockName`      | The name of the [skill](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Skills) required for unlock.

### Forge recipes
Recipes for the Forge added in Vanilla 1.5 update can be added via Json Assets through the `Forge` folder.

An object subfolder for a recipe is a folder that contains these files:

* an `recipe.json`;

field                  | purpose
---------------------- | -------
`BaseItemName`         | (string) The name of the Item that is to be put on the left slot for the recipe.
`IngredientContextTag` | (string) The item for the right slot must have this ContextTag for the Forge recipe to Work. (See Context Tags Section)
`CinderShardCost`      | (int) The amount of Cinder Shard required for the receipe.
`ResultItemName`       | (string) The name of the output item

Custom ContextTags can be added to vanilla items using ContentPatcher.

## Common features
### Gift tastes
Supported for: objects.

You can add gift taste support to any pre-existing content pack by adding the following to the respective `.json` file. It does not matter where you put it. I tend to place it at the bottom of the `.json` but it is personal preferance. 

If it can be gifted to an NPC it has gift taste support built in. This means `big-craftables`, `hats`, `weapons`, `shirts`, `pants`, `boots`, `tailoring` and `fences` do not have gift taste support. If you exclude an NPC from the gift taste, their reaction will their default reaction to that item's category. This applies to custom NPCs as well if they are not specified.

```
 "GiftTastes":
    {
        "Love": [],
        "Like": [],
        "Neutral": [],
        "Dislike": [],
        "Hate": [],
    },
```
An example of a filled out gift taste can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/paradigmnomad/df8686af71ff35428dc37a7db65213bf#gift-tastes). You can delete unused fields within `GiftTastes`.

### Shops
Supported for: all content types.

The `PurchaseFrom` field lets you add items to shops for the player to buy. Each shop has up to
three IDs you can use, in order of preference:
1. **owner ID:** a (usually) unique value used to create the shop.
2. **portrait ID:** the default name of the NPC whose portrait is shown in the shop UI.
3. **context ID:** the location containing the shop (not necessarily unique).

You can use any ID to identify the shop, but should avoid the context ID if possible since multiple
shops in the same location will have the same context ID.

Here are the IDs for vanilla shops (crossed out IDs match multiple vanilla shops):

world area | shop                                                                | owner ID      | portrait ID     | context ID

For custom shops, here's how to find the ID:

1. Install the _SMAPI for developers_ version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) (to show more info in
   the SMAPI console).
2. Load the game and open the shop.
3. The SMAPI console will show a `TRACE` message like this:
   > [Json Assets] Adding objects for shop IDs 'SeedShop', 'Pierre'.

**For custom shop mod authors:** when creating a custom shop, you can set the `string who` argument
in the `ShopMenu` constructor to give it an owner ID. Prefixing the value with your mod ID (like
`your-mod-id/shop-key`) is recommended to avoid conflicts with other mods.

### Context tags
Supported for: objects.

Context tags are an array in the item "ContextTags", injected into `Data\ObjectContextTags`. It allows mods like [Better Shop Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2012) to categorize your items better. This is an optional feature and not required for a content pack to work.

Example:

```
"ContextTags":
        [
        "season_summer",
        "color_yellow",
        "fruit_tree_item",
        "fruit_item"
        ],
```

You can include as much or as little information you want to with context tags.
Common information in context tags are: season, main color, what produces the item, and what type the item is.

You can see a list of context tags under `Content/Data/ObjectInformation` An alternative way to check a pre-exisiting items context tags is "Typing in `debug listtags` into SMAPI [will] print out all of the context tags for that item." (Mr. Podunkian) You aren't limited to those context tags, but it gives you an idea of the vanilla context tags.

### Localization
Supported for: all content types.

You can translate your items' name/description fields directly in your content pack. There are two
ways to add translations.

#### Self-contained translations
You can add `NameLocalization` and `DescriptionLocalization` fields directly in the item's JSON
file (e.g. `hat.json` for a hat), and provide the text for any number of [language
codes](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations). If there's no translation for the
current language, the default `Name`/`Description` will be used instead.

For example:

```js
"Name": "Surfing Trophy",
"Description": "A trophy for winning the surfing festival.",
"NameLocalization": {
    "ko": "서핑 트로피",
    "ru": "Приз лучшего сёрфера"
},
"DescriptionLocalization": {
    "ko": "서핑 페스티벌 우승 트로피.",
    "ru": "Награда за победу на фестивале сёрфинга."
}
```

For crops and fruit trees, prefix `Seed` and `Sapling` respectively (e.g. `SeedNameLocalization`).

This keeps all your item data together, but it may be harder to maintain translations for larger
content packs.

#### Standard translations
You can add a `TranslationKey` field to the item's JSON file, and put the translations in your
content pack's [standard `i18n` folder](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations). For
example:

```js
// in BigCraftables/SurfingTrophy/craftable.json:
{
    "Name": "Surfing Trophy",
    "Price": 500,
    "TranslationKey": "item.surfing-trophy"
}

// in i18n/ko.json:
{
    "item.surfing-trophy.name": "서핑 트로피",
    "item.surfing-trophy.description": "서핑 페스티벌 우승 트로피."
}
```

For crops and fruit trees, prefix `Seed` and `Sapling` respectively (e.g. `SeedTranslationKey`).

Translations are merged into the `NameLocalization` and `DescriptionLocalization` fields, so they
work exactly the same way. The `Name` field is always required, but you can set a display name in
the `i18n/default.json` file.

## Integration with Content Patcher
Json Assets adds several custom tokens to [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915),
so you can use Json Assets data in your Content Patcher packs.

To enable the tokens, add Json Assets as a dependency to your content pack's `manifest.json`:
```js
"Dependencies": [
    {
        "UniqueID": "spacechase0.JsonAssets"
    }
]
```

Then you can use the tokens directly in your `content.json` just like any other token:
```js
{
    "Action": "EditImage",
    "Target": "{{spacechase0.JsonAssets/CropSpriteTilesheet: Honeysuckle}}",
    "FromFile": "Honeysuckle.png",
    "ToArea": {
        "X": "{{spacechase0.JsonAssets/CropSpriteX: Honeysuckle}}",
        "Y": "{{spacechase0.JsonAssets/CropSpriteY: Honeysuckle}}",
        "Width": "16",
        "Height": "32"
    }
},
```

The tokens below are defined for each of these categories: `Object`, `BigCraftable`, `Crop`,
`FruitTree`, `Hat`, and `Weapon`. Shirts and pants are not currently supported.

The available tokens (all prefixed with `spacechase0.JsonAssets/`):

<table>
<tr>
<th>token</th>
<th>usage</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>{category}Id</code></td>
<td>

Get the ID for the custom item with the given name. This ID is assigned dynamically when the save is
loaded.

For example, `{{spacechase0.JsonAssets/ObjectId: Honeysuckle}}` gets the ID for the custom
honeysuckle item.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>{category}SpriteTilesheet</code></td>
<td>

The tilesheet which contains the sprite for the named custom item, suitable for use in Content
Patcher's `Target` field. This is needed because custom items aren't necessarily in the vanilla
tilesheets.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>{category}SpriteX</code><br /><code>{category}SpriteY</code></td>
<td>

The sprite's X and Y pixel positions in the tilesheet for the named custom item, suitable for use
in Content Patcher's `FromArea` and `ToArea` fields.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Releasing a content pack
See [content packs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Content_packs) on the wiki for general
info. Suggestions:

1. Add specific install steps in your mod description to help players:
   ```
   [size=5]Install[/size]
   [list=1]
   [*][url=https://smapi.io]Install the latest version of SMAPI[/url].
   [*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720]Install Json Assets[/url].
   [*]Download this mod and unzip it into [font=Courier New]Stardew Valley/Mods[/font].
   [*]Run the game using SMAPI.
   [/list]
   ```
2. When editing the Nexus page, add Json Assets under 'Requirements'. Besides reminding players to install it first, it'll also add your content pack to the list on the Json Asset page.

### Manifest
Here's an example of a JsonAssets manifest. You can find more information about manifest in general [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest).

```
{
    "Name": "[JA] Your Project Name",
    "Author": "Your Name",
    "Version": "1.0.0",
    "Description": "One or two sentences about the mod.",
    "UniqueID": "YourName.YourProjectName",
    "UpdateKeys": [],
    "ContentPackFor": {
        "UniqueID": "spacechase0.JsonAssets"
    },
}
```

## Troubleshooting
There are some common errors with easy solutions. Your error may look slightly different but the general principal is the same. For a more in depth FAQ visit [this](https://github.com/paradigmnomad/PPJA/wiki/Troubleshooting) link. FAQ is a work in progress.

### Target out of range
```
   Exception injecting crop sprite for Blue_Mist: System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: The target area is outside the bounds of the target texture.
   Parameter name: targetArea
   at StardewModdingAPI.Framework.Content.AssetDataForImage.PatchImage(Texture2D source, Nullable`1 sourceArea, Nullable`1 targetArea, PatchMode patchMode) in C:\source\_Stardew\SMAPI\src\SMAPI\Framework\Content\AssetDataForImage.cs:line 44
   at JsonAssets.ContentInjector.Edit[T](IAssetData asset) in G:\StardewValley\Mods\JsonAssets\ContentInjector.cs:line 194
```
Solution: The sprite is too big. Double check what size the image needs to be for that specific type of item and crop your image accordingly.

### Exception injecting given key
```
   Exception injecting cooking recipe for Bulgogi: System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.
   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key)
   at JsonAssets.Mod.ResolveObjectId(Object data) in G:\StardewValley\Mods\JsonAssets\Mod.cs:line 336
   at JsonAssets.Data.ObjectData.Recipe_.GetRecipeString(ObjectData parent) in G:\StardewValley\Mods\JsonAssets\Data\ObjectData.cs:line 60
   at JsonAssets.ContentInjector.Edit[T](IAssetData asset) in G:\StardewValley\Mods\JsonAssets\ContentInjector.cs:line 98
 ```
Solution: There is something missing from the recipe. This is caused by not installing a dependency or typing in an item ID/Name wrong. Install the dependencies (often listed on the download page) or open up the `.json` file and see if you typed something wrong.

### Exception injecting duplicate key
```
   Exception injecting cooking recipe for Bacon: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.
   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentException(ExceptionResource resource)
   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Insert(TKey key, TValue value, Boolean add)
   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Add(TKey key, TValue value)
   at JsonAssets.ContentInjector.Edit[T](IAssetData asset) in G:\StardewValley\Mods\JsonAssets\ContentInjector.cs:line 99Exception i
 ```
 Solution: There is already an item with that name. This can happen when: using mods that have the same items, having two of the same file in different locations, or accidently naming something with the same name. Double check all folders and rename accordingly.

 Sometimes the error will not tell you which item is causing it, only that an item with the same key has already been added. This makes it harder to track down the culprit but it means the same thing. This error may appear for every JA object even if only one is a duplicate name. If it recently started happening, removing the most recently added packs may resolve it and will help you narrow down your search for the offending item/pack.
 If you're asking for help with this your log will be large, which can reduce the chances of people being able to help because it may not load.

### Invalid JSON
```
Exception loading content pack: Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException: Can't parse JSON file at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods\[JA] Berries\Crops\Berries\crop.json. This doesn't seem to be valid JSON.
Technical details: Invalid property identifier character: [. Path 'Seasons', line 8, position 27.
   at StardewModdingAPI.Toolkit.Serialization.JsonHelper.ReadJsonFileIfExists[TModel](String fullPath, TModel& result) in C:\source\_Stardew\SMAPI\src\SMAPI.Toolkit\Serialization\JsonHelper.cs:line 74
   at StardewModdingAPI.Framework.ContentPack.ReadJsonFile[TModel](String path) in C:\source\_Stardew\SMAPI\src\SMAPI\Framework\ContentPack.cs:line 76
   at JsonAssets.Mod.loadData(IContentPack contentPack) in G:\StardewValley\Mods_1.4\JsonAssets\Mod.cs:line 471
   at JsonAssets.Mod.onTick(Object sender, UpdateTickedEventArgs e) in G:\StardewValley\Mods_1.4\JsonAssets\Mod.cs:line 158
```

Solution: There is something wrong with the JSON. You can see which one is causing the error at the end of the filepath. In this example it's the Berries crop.json on line 8. Correcting these errors will resolve the issue. JA will only show one invalid JSON at a time. You may have to load the game and check the SMAPI log multiple times to remove all invalid JSON errors if you have multiple.

### Previous clothing items gone
Solution: If you have previously used clothing added via Content Patcher it will show as a blank object. Opening and closing the menu can solve this issue.

It is recommended you remove any Content Patcher mods that are now being handled by Json Assets before adding in the Json Assets version to avoid this.
