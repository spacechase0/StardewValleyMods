**Three-Heart Dance Partner** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you
dance with a villager at the Flower Dance with three hearts instead of four, so it's achievable
in the first year.

## Install
1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/500).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
The mod works automatically once installed. If you have at least three hearts with an NPC, they'll
accept at the Flower Festival if you ask them to dance.

### Formula
The Flower Dance happens on spring 24, which gives you 23 days to get three hearts (750 points)
with the NPC of your choice.

To achieve that in year one, you can talk to them every day (+20 points/day) and give them two
liked gifts per week (+45 points/gift). That gives you `(23 days × 20 points) + (4 weeks × 2 gifts
× 45 points)` or 820 points. You can use [Lookup Anything](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541)
to see your exact friendship points with an NPC.

## Compatibility
Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5+ on Linux/macOS/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
